* **Try/Catch**
* **Syntactic Sugar**  
Syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.  
Specifically, a construct in a language is called syntactic sugar if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do: functionality and expressive power will remain the same.  
Examples: decorators, list comprehension, accessing vector elements by index
*  **Annotations/Decorators**  
preceded by the at sign (@) (@ = AT, as in annotation type
* **Race Condition**  
The behavior of an electronic, software or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first.
* **Polymorphism**  
In English, polymorphism is the condition of occurring in several different forms.  
In computer science, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.  It comes in several flavors:  
  - *ad hoc polymorphism*:
  function overloading
  - *parametric polymorphism*:
  generic programming
  - *subtyping*:
  when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass
