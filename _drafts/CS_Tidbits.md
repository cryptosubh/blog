* **Try/Catch**
* **Race Condition**  
The behavior of an electronic, software or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first.
* **Polymorphism**  
In English, polymorphism is the condition of occurring in several different forms.  
In computer science, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.  It comes in several flavors:  
  - *ad hoc polymorphism*:
  function overloading
  - *parametric polymorphism*:
  generic programming
  - *subtyping*:
  when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass
