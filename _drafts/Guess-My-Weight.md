title: Guess My Weight
---

My height is in the fifth percentile for women my age.  Which percentile do you think I'm in for weight?  

<ol type="a">
  <li>5th percentile</li>
  <li>10th percentile, so I should lose 8 pounds to get down to the 5th.</li>
  <li>10th percentile, which is probably about average for my height.</li>
  <li>A lady never tells.</li>
</ol>

By the way, the correct answer is C.  

Additional discussion questions:

* If my sister scored in the 92nd percentile for Biological Science, and 96th percentile for Physical Science, and the 99th percentiles for both Verbal and Social Science, then in what percentile was her overall MCAT score? (Answer: Very high 99th.)
* If my mom is the 15th percentile for height and my dad is in the 5th, then why did I end up in the fifth?
* If my husband and I are both in the fifth percentile for height, how much growth hormone will our children need?
