title: Guess My Weight
---

My height is in the fifth percentile for women my age.  What percentile do you think I'm in for weight?  

<ol type="a">
  <li>5th percentile</li>
  <li>10th percentile, so I should lose 8 pounds to get down to the 5th.</li>
  <li>10th percentile, which is probably about average for my height.</li>
  <li>A lady never tells.</li>
</ol>


Additional questions:

* If my mom is the 15th percentile for height and my dad is in the 5th, then why did I end up in the fifth?
* If 
* If my husband and I are both in the fifth percentile for height, how much growth hormone will our children need?
