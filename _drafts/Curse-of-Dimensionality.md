title: The Curse of Dimesionality
---

Generalizing to higher dimensions is one area where mathematicians have usually excelled.  While others fear what they cannot visualize, 
mathematicians bravely add another coordinate or change a two to a three and BOOM! 

I've always been fascinated by problems that *don't* generalize -- problems where we can perfectly characterize everything that is 
happening in two, three, or maybe even four dimensions, and after that [have no idea] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_number_problem).

In statistics, there are more methods than theorems, and sometimes methods don't work so well in high dimensions.
