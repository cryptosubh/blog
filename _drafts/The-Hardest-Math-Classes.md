title: What are the Hardest Math Classes? 
---

Before you click the "READ MORE" link below, take a guess which math class(es) I am most requested to tutor. No peeking or cheating!  

Answer: geometry for high schoolers, probability & statistics for college students and young adults.  

Runner-ups: Trigonometry, discrete/finite math.  Requests from distressed high schoolers who did worse than expected in geometry last year and are still scarred from the experience. 

Notice what doesn't doesn't crack the top 5: Calculus.  Algebra.  

Hopefully, upon reflection, my readers can relate.  I certainly can.  Geometry was without a doubt my weakest math area in high school.  Whenever I took a math competition, I'd auto-skip the harder geometry questions: I knew 30-60-90 triangles and parallel lines, but after that I was pretty much out of tricks.
