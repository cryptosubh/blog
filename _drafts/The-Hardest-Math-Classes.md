title: What are the Hardest Math Classes? 
---

Before you click the "READ MORE" link below, take a guess which math class(es) I am most requested to tutor. No peeking or cheating!  

Answer: geometry for high schoolers, probability & statistics for college students and young adults.  

Runner-ups: Trigonometry, discrete/finite math.  Requests from distressed high schoolers who did worse than expected in geometry last year and are still scarred from the experience. 

Notice what doesn't doesn't crack the top 5: Calculus.  Algebra.  

Hopefully, upon reflection, my readers can relate.  I certainly can.  Geometry was without a doubt my weakest math area in high school.  Whenever I took a math competition, I'd auto-skip the harder geometry questions: I knew 30-60-90 triangles and parallel line theorems, but after that I was pretty much out of tricks.  When I had to visualize higher dimensions for multivariable calculus, . 

In most high schools, calculus is considered the crowning acheivement of your mathematical career, a course only to be attempted after the rigorous and highly-redundant two-year algII/precalc sequence.  

At my high school, almost everyone took calculus except for a small handful of the weakest students, who were relegated to some statistics/finite math mash-up class.  Almost no one took AP stats. (I tried to sign up junior year and but it wouldn't fit in my schedule.)  

I think this system is unfortunate for two reasons.  The first is that statistics is incredibly important, and applies to as many if not more fields than calculus does.  And the second is that statistics is actually incredibly nuanced, the details and assumptions so subtle but crucial.
