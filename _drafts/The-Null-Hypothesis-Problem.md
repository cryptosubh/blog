title: Social Sciences' Null Hypothesis Problem
---


A very common algorithm taught in Statistics 101 is how to demonstrate a statistically significant association between two variables x and y.  The first step the algorithm is to assume the null hypothesis: that there is *no* association between x and y.

A lot of my students are understandably confused by this step.  If we are trying to show an association, why do we start out by assuming the opposite? 

If you set out to show hypothesis X, and you end up showing hypothesis X, I'm not all that impressed.  

Here are two hypotheses which I find personally unpleasant but statistically compelling:
1. The gender disparity in many fields will probably never disappear. 
I would love to have more female peers in math, but the overwhelming evidence suggests that the gender disparity in STEM is largely due to genetic factors.
2. School choice might not produce better outcomes for students.
In theory I support free market solutions to economic issues, but the evidence in support of charter schools and other school choice systems is currently pretty thin.
