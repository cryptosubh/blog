title: Mathematical Tidiness
---

Hopefully, you have had the experience of tackling an unfamiliar math problem where you didn't know the solution or even the general approach ahead of time. (If not, then the system has failed you.  Everyone should work on challenging math problems!) 

You grab a blank sheet of paper and scribble down the premise of the problem and anything else that comes to mind.  In the best case scenario, which we will call situation A, a light bulb will eventually click on, and a few equal signs later the answer will tumble onto the page in front of you.  Congrats!

In the worst case scenario, which we will call B, you will bang your against a wall, derive a few irrelevant truths like 1 = 1, forget what you were even solving for, and give up.  This experience, while unpleasant, is the only reliable way to improve as a mathematician.

As a tutor, I have the privilege of watching people tackle problems that are unfamiliar and challenging to them every single day.  My job is to minimize the amount of time my students spend chasing their tails and embarking down the wrong path by providing hints, and being a friendly and supportive presence :D.

I spend a lot of time thinking about why some of my students end up in situation A versus situation B.  It depends on a lot of factors, not least of which are intelligence, persistence, and a willingness to be wrong --  factors over which I have little control. 

I used to think that the mess that people write on the page reflected the mess going on inside their heads, concepts who nuances were not understood and therefore could not translate in written form.  I still believe this is true, but only half true.  

I am not a particularly tidy person in my personal life.  I leave dishes in the sink and throw my clothes on the floor.  My handwriting is legible but not uniform or beautiful.  I have no talent for sketching or painting.  

Mathematical tidiness is different from personal tidiness.
