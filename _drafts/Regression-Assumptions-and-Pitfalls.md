title: Regression Assumptions and Pitfalls

Linear regression is overused, and all too often it's used inappropriately.  Here's a list of the assumptions underpinning linear regression, and an explanation of what goes wrong when each rule is violated.

1. Linearity of the Data  

A caveat: even if the relationship between x and y is not globally linear, it might be reasonably approximated by a line when we restrict x to a certain domain.  That's fine; just make sure not to extrapolate beyond the restricted region.
