title: Clean Code

I'm reading a book called *Clean Code* and it is fantastic.  
The author, a Swedish developer who inexplicably refers to himself as "Uncle Bob", is dramatic, arrogant, obsessive, and brilliant.
Here are some gems:
> Flag arguments are ugly.  Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice.  
> Side effects are lies.  Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does other *hidden* things.
