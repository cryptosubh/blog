title: Clean Code

I'm reading a book called *Clean Code* and it is fantastic.  
The author, a Swedish developer who inexplicably refers to himself as "Uncle Bob", is dramatic, arrogant, obsessive, and brilliant.
Here are some gems:
> Flag arguments are ugly.  Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice.

<div></div>
> Side effects are lies.  Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does other *hidden* things.  

<div></div>
> The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.  Note that I use the word *failure*.  I mean it.  Comments are always failures.  We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration.
