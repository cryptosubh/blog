title: We Should All Be More Suspicious of Statistics
---

Statistics is an amazing field because it provides us with tools to estimate unknowable quantities. It's a big, complicated world out there, and every statistical study has limitations and uncertainties.

To this end, we should all become more discerning consumers of statistics.  We should refuse to quote statistics when we don't have 
infomation about how these statistics were calculated and the methodologies researchers used to collect data.  And we should treat a statistic without an accompanying standard error as the random variable that it is!

Here are some often-cited statistics of which I am skeptical:

* By 2100, the average temperature on Earth will rise 8-9 degrees Farenheit. {https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/future.html}  
Weather is an extremely chaotic system, which means that small changes in initial conditions (i.e., the weather right now) can lead to drastic changes in outcomes (i.e., weather forecasts in the future).  This is also known as the Butterfly Effect, because of the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a tornado across the world.  And this is why, even though multiple companies use supercomputers to measure temperature and air pressure across the surface of the earth, their forecasts for over 10 days out don't even beat historical averages. So I'm highly skeptical of anyone who claims to predict weather in 100 years.  Note that this doesn't mean that I don't believe in the phenomenon of global warming, or the possibility of climate change.  But I believe more strongly that we don't need to make up fake statistics to support real phenomena!
* Just 2% of rape accusations are false. {https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-09-19/how-many-rape-reports-are-false}  
This statistic suffers from both numerator and denominator issues - namely, that we haven't indicated what counts as an "accusation" and who gets to decide whether or not it is false.  We'd have to limit the scope of our statement to "accusations formally filed at a University" or "accusations that go to trial in a court of law".  And Even then it's nearly impossible to determine which accusations are false.  Because rape cases usually involve only two people, one or both of which were intoxicated.  And while other heinous crimes like murder are not usually consenual, sex often is.  So the percentage of rape of accusations that are false is an unknowable quantity, and just like the weather in 100 years, is extremely difficult to estimate. In fact, the only thing that I am quite certain of is that the number is greater than 2%.  
* Women earn 77 cents for every dollar that men make.  
This is probably the most legitimate statistic of the three, in that numbers in the high 70s / low 80s are supported by several credible studies, so taken at face value this statement is fairly accurate. However, I think the number is misleading because it doesn't take into account the fact that women are more likely than men to work in lower-paying industries and to log fewer hours at their job per week.
