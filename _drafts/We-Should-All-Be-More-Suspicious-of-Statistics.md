title: We Should All Be More Suspicious of Statistics
---

Statistics is an amazing field because it provides us with tools to estimate unknowable quantities. It's a big, complicated world out there, and every statistical study has limitations and uncertainties.
To this end, we should all become more discerning consumers of statistics.  We should refuse to quote statistics when we don't have 
infomation about how these statists were calculated.  

Here are some often-cited that I am suspicious of:

* Women make earn 77 cents for every dollar that men make.
* 2% of rape accusations are false.
* By 2100, the average temperature on Earth will rise 8-9 degree Farenheit. [https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/future.html]
