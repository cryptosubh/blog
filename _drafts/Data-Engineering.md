title: Data Engineering

Data engineering is like finance in that there is a lot of jargon and you just have to hang out with people who use the language until it sinks in.  There will probably come a time when words like *throughput* and *atomicity* feel obvious to me, but for now they just feel really unnatural.  I pretty much look up *throughput* every time I read it (or hear it).  


Data engineers spend a lot of time worrying about *node failure*, for  a computer goes down due t.  This used to seem ridiculous to me.  I use my computer every day, to check my email and chat with my friends and read blogs.  Occassionally my computer fails; I reboot it and proceed with my life.  NBD.
