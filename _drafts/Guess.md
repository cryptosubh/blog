title: Guess 
---

Take a guess which math class(es) I am most requested to tutor. No peeking or cheating!  

Answer: geometry for high schoolers, probability & statistics for college students and young adults.  

Runner-ups: Trignometry, discrete math.  Requests from distressed high schoolers who did worse than expected in geometry last year and are still scarred from the experience. 

Notice what doesn't doesn't crack the top 5: Calculus.  Algebra.
