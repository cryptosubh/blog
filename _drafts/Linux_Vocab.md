Most of the definitions come from *The Linux Command Line* by William E. Shotts Jr.

####Chapter 1: What is the Shell?  
* **shell**  
A program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out.  Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called **bash**.
* **bash**  
Stands for "Bourne Again Shell".  An enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.
* **terminal emulator**  
Gives you access to interact with the shell.  Examples: konsole, gnome-terminal
* **superuser**  
A special user account used for system administration.  On Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser.   Root is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes.


####Chapter 2: Navigation  
* **heirarchical directory structure**  
Linux organizes its files in a tree-like pattern of directories (ie, folders) which may contain files and other directories
* **root directory**  
The first directory in the file system
* **pathname**  
The route we take along the branches of the tree to get to the directory we want  
  - *absolute pathname*:
  begin with the root, represented by a leading slash /
  - *relative pathname*:
  begin with the working directory, represented by ./ or just implied!
  
####Chapter 3: Exploring the System
* **pagers**  
A class of programs that allow for easy viewing of long text documents in a page-by-page manner. Example: *less*
* **Linux Filesystem Heirarchy Standard**  
Defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems
* **symbolic link** or **soft link** or **symlink**  
the nickname for any file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution

####Chapter 4: Manipulating Files & Directories
* **wildcard**  
A symbol that can stand for one or more characters
* **globbing**  
The process of expanding a non-specific file name containing a wildcard character into a set of specific file names that exist in storage on a computer, server, or network
* **hard link**  
the nickname for any file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution
* **inode**  
the nickname for any file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution
