I graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a B.A. in Mathematics.  
I started this blog to motivate and document my study of data science, and to gain familiarity with github.


### Side Interests

Side interests include musical theatre, bridge, yoga, the New York Times crossword puzzle, and watching baseball, basketball, and football. 

### Tutoring

I tutor math and CS in Manhattan between the east village and the UES. My per-hour rate is $120 off wyzant ($150 through wyzant), but discounts may be available if you are taking a class that aligns with my interests :).
