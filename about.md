I graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a B.A. in Mathematics.  I started this blog to motivate and document my study of data science, and to gain familiarity with github.


### Side Interests

Side interests include musical theatre, bridge, yoga, thrift store shopping, the New York Times crossword puzzle, and watching baseball, basketball, and football. 

### Tutoring

I tutor Math and CS in Manhattan between the LES and the UES. My rate is $120/hr off-wyzant and $150/hr through wyzant.  Discounts may be available if you are taking a class that aligns with my interests :).
