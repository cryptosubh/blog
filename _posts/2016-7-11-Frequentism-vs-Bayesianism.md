I asked a friend to explain the difference between frequentism and bayesianism and he directed me to this very educational work of art:

Randall Munroe's attitude towards frequentism is pretty typical for a mathematician; a class in probability will emphasize Bayes' theorem and calculating probabilities by conditioning.  And yet almost every technique taught in AP Statistics is 100% Frequentist, from hypothesis intervals to confidence tests!  Sorry to play both sides, but I see merit in each methodology. 

Speaking on bayesian probabilities, I got the following problem from a potential student.  I didn't end up tutoring him, but I had a lot of fun working on the problem anyway!
