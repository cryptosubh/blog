title: Frequentism

I asked a friend to explain the difference between frequentism and bayesianism and he directed me to this very educational work of art:

Randall Munroe's attitude towards frequentism is pretty typical for a mathematician; a class in probability will emphasize Bayes' theorem and calculating probabilities by conditioning.  And yet almost every technique taught in AP Statistics is 100% Frequentist, from hypothesis intervals to confidence tests!  Sorry to play both sides, but I see merit in each methodology. 

Speaking on bayesian probabilities, I got the following problem from a potential student.  I didn't end up tutoring him, but I had a lot of fun working on the problem anyway!

> DMD is a serious form of Muscular Dystrophy, a sex-linked recessive disease. 
> * If a woman is a carrier, her sons have a 50% chance of being affected; daughters have a 50% chance of being carriers
> * 2/3 of DMD cases are inherited from Mom; 1/3 of DMD cases are due to spontaneous mutations
> * There is a screening test to check whether a woman is a carrier such that
   + P(T+|C+) = .7
   + P(T-|C-) = .9  
where T+ and T- are the events that the test is positive and negative, respectively, and C+ and C- are the events that a woman is and is not a carrier, respectively. 

> A woman has a child with DMD and then has a screening test done to see if she is a carrier. If the test comes back positive, what is the probability that she is a carrier?  What if the screening test is negative?
