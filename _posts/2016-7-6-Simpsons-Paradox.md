Today I learned about Simpson's Paradox.  

Simpson's Paradox is a 

Every Simpson's paradox involves at least three variables:
1. the explained
2. the observed explanatory
3. the lurking explanatory

If the effect of the observed explanatory variable on the explained variable changes directions when you account for the lurking explanatory variable, you've got a Simpson's Paradox.
For example, to the right, x appears to have a negative effect on y, but the opposite is true when you account for color. y is the explained variable, x the observed explanatory variable, and color the lurking explanatory variable.



As our society grows more diverse, Simpson’s paradox may make more frequent appearances. Scholars and policy-makers will have to be mindful as they examine long-term changes of social and economic progress. It would be a shame if real progress in these areas was overlooked because of a naïve reliance on single averages.
