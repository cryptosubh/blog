title: Simpson's Paradox
---

Every Simpson's paradox involves at least three variables:

* the explained (y)
* the observed explanatory (x<sub>1</sub>)
* the lurking explanatory (x<sub>2</sub>)

If the effect of the observed explanatory variable on the explained variable changes directions when you account for the lurking explanatory variable, you've got a Simpson's Paradox.

In every example I've seen, both explanatory variables x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> are qualitative and each have a demonstrable and crucially, *opposite*, association with y.  Problems arise when splitting the sample by both factors yields unequally-sized classes.  The unequal group sizes can weight the results incorrectly, leading to seriously flawed conclusions. 

Simpson's Paradox will generally not be a problem in a well designed experiment or survey if possible lurking variables are identified ahead of time and properly controlled. This includes eliminating them, holding them constant for all groups or making them part of the study.

As our society grows more diverse, Simpson’s paradox may make more frequent appearances. Scholars and policy-makers will have to be mindful as they examine long-term changes of social and economic progress. It would be a shame if real progress in these areas was overlooked because of a naïve reliance on single averages.
