Today I learned about Simpson's Paradox.  

Every Simpson's paradox involves at least three variables:
1. the explained (y)
2. the observed explanatory (x_1)
3. the lurking explanatory (x_2)

If the effect of the observed explanatory variable on the explained variable changes directions when you account for the lurking explanatory variable, you've got a Simpson's Paradox.
For example, to the right, x appears to have a negative effect on y, but the opposite is true when you account for color. y is the explained variable, x the observed explanatory variable, and color the lurking explanatory variable.



As our society grows more diverse, Simpson’s paradox may make more frequent appearances. Scholars and policy-makers will have to be mindful as they examine long-term changes of social and economic progress. It would be a shame if real progress in these areas was overlooked because of a naïve reliance on single averages.
