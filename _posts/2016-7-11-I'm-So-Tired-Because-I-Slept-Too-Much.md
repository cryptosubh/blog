title: I Get Really Tired When I Sleep Too Much.
---

"I'm so tired because I slept too much."  I've probably heard a dozen people make this claim, and the statement has always baffled me. It makes about as much sense as saying: "I'm so hungry because I ate too much."

For one, because everyone knows that correlation doesn't imply causation.  So even though fatigue and copious amounts of shut-eye may coincide, there may not be a causal relationship between the two - it may be a coincidence, or they may both be caused by a third, "hidden" variable that we haven't considered yet.
