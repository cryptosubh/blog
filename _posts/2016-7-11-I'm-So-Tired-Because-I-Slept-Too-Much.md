title: I Get Really Tired When I Sleep Too Much.
---

"I'm so tired because I slept too much."  I've probably heard a dozen people make this claim, and the statement has always baffled me. It makes about as much sense as saying, "I'm so hungry because I ate too much."

Everyone knows that correlation doesn't imply causation.  So even though heightened fatigue and copious amounts of shut-eye may coincide, there may not be a causal relationship between the two. The association might be a coincidence, or they may both be caused by a third, "hidden" variable that we haven't considered yet.

But there is a pretty well-accepted causal relation between sleep and fatigue: we sleep because we are tired. If sleeping also produced fatigue then most of us would be stuck in a pretty unproductive state of permanent hibernation!


I asked a friend to explain the difference between frequentism and bayesianism and he directed me to this very educational work of art:
