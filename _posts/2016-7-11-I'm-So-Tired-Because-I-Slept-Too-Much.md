title: I'm So Tired Because I Slept Too Much
---

"I get really tired when I sleep too much."  I've probably heard a dozen people make this claim, and the statement has always baffled me. It makes about as much sense as saying: "I get really hungry when I eat too much."

For one, because everyone knows that correlation doesn't imply causation.  So even though fatigue and copious amounts of shut-eye may coincide, there may not be a causal relationship between the two - it may be a coincidence, or they may both be caused by a third, "hidden" variable that we haven't considered yet.
